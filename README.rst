``logstash_forwarder``
------------

Install the ``logstash-forwarder`` package, set up configuration file,  
optionally set up the lumberjack certificate, and enable the service. This 
formula currently supports Debian and RedHat based distributions.  Although the
packages for Debian and RedHat provide service init files, we manage it within
this formula for two reasons:

* The RedHat service init file is currently broken, see 
  <https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash-forwarder/pull/196>
* By default, init files for both distro families enables 'log-to-syslog' when invoking 
  logstash-forwarder, which can pollute your syslog with unnecessary noise.  By default
  this feature will remain on, but it can be turned off by setting logstash_forwarder:log_to_syslog
  to false in your pillar data.

Usage
=====

See pillar.example for an example configuration.

Example
=======
The easiest way to understand the formula is to look at an example.  The following is example pillar data:

::
    
    logstash_forwarder:
        servers: 
            - logs.example.com:5000
        files:
            -
                paths:
                    - /var/log/syslog
                    - /var/log/auth.log
                fields:
                    type: syslog
        cert_path: /etc/ssl/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt
        cert_contents: |

            -----END CERTIFICATE-----

In this example, we are supplying the lumberjack certificate through pillar.
This is optional.  If you want to manage your certificates some other way,
omit cert_contents and set cert_path to the path of the externally managed
certificate.

The example pillar data would result in the following logstash-forwarder
config:

::

    {
      "network": {
        "servers": [
          "logs.example.com:5000"
        ],
        "timeout": 15,
        "ssl ca": "/etc/ssl/certs/logstash-forwarder.crt"
      },
      "files": [
        {
          "paths": [
                "/var/log/syslog",
                "/var/log/auth.log"
            ],
          "fields": {
                "type": "syslog"
            }
        }
       ]
    }

Pillar Data Explained
---------------------

The pillar data is structured as a dictionary with key 'logstash_forwarder'
with the following required keys:

* servers: A list of logstash lumberjack endpoints, in "<host>:<port>" form
* ssl ca: A string containing the path of the lumberjack certificate file
* files: A list of dictionaries containing a list of files, and optionally
  a dictionary of fields to annotate on each event (see logstash-forwarder 
  documentation).

By default, this formula will configure the 'ssl ca' path to 
'logstash-forwarder.crt' in the system default certificate directory,
/etc/ssl/certs on Debian distros and /etc/pki/tls/certs on RedHat distros.
You can override this default by including 'cert_path' in your pillar data.
You can also optionally populate that file with the appropriate certificate
data by setting 'cert_contents' as shown in the example pillar data.

Overriding Platform Defaults
-------------------
This formula sets up certain defaults in map.jinja, specifically:

* Name of the logstash-forwarder package is logstash-forwarder
* Name of the logstash-forwarder service is logstash-forwarder
* The latest version of logstash available will be installed  
  and kept up to date, instead of a one-time install of the latest version
* The timeout will be 15 seconds

These settings can be overridden by adding the appropriate keys to your
pillar data, for example::
    logstash_forwarder:
        pkg: logstash-forwarder-altversion
        svc: logstash-forwarder-alterversion
        timeout: 90
